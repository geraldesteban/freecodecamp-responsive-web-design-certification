          <p class="info-description">
            Follow a chronology of the singer's life, highlighted by
            breathtaking commercial success, intense public scrutiny and odd
            lifestyle choices:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Aug. 29, 1958:</strong> Michael Joseph Jackson is born to
              Katherine and Joe Jackson in Gary, Ind. His older siblings are
              Rebbie, Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, LaToya and Marlon. Later, brother
              Randy and sister Janet join the family. Katherine Jackson raises
              her children as Jehovah's Witnesses.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1962:</strong> Michael, Marlon, Jackie, Tito and Jermaine
              combine to form a band. At first, their father does not approve,
              but later changes his mind and manages the band. Jackson sings
              lead vocal on most of the songs.
            </li>
            <li><strong>1968:</strong> Motown signs The Jackson 5.</li>
            <li>
              <strong>1969:</strong> The song "I Want You Back" jumps to the
              number-one singles spot. "ABC (1970)," "The Love You Save" and
              "I'll Be There" follow suit.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1971-1972:</strong> Jackson goes solo, and his singles
              "Got to Be There," "Rockin' Robin" and "I Wanna Be Where You Are"
              storm the charts — as does "Ben," a ballad about a pet rat
              featured in the horror movie Ben.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1978:</strong> Jackson makes his film debut as the
              Scarecrow in The Wiz, an urban retelling of the classic film The
              Wizard Of Oz. Diana Ross co-stars as Dorothy. Jackson is said to
              wear his makeup long after production hours.

            <li>
              <strong>1979:</strong> Jackson records Off The Wall, his first

              <strong>1982-1983:</strong> Jackson releases the album Thriller,
              and it tops the charts for 37 weeks. Seven singles dash into the
              top 10, including "Billie Jean," "Beat It," "Thriller" and "Wanna
              Be Startin' Somethin'." The extended video sequence on "Thriller"
              has Jackson morph into a werewolf. Jackson unveils his signature
              dance move, the moonwalk.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1984:</strong> Questions arise about Jackson's changing
              appearance, and some wonder if the singer has had plastic surgery.

              with its own amusement park rides, and calls it Neverland.

            <li>
              <strong>1992:</strong> Jackson tells Oprah Winfrey he has

              humiliating ordeal of my life," he says in a televised statement
              in December.

            <li>
              <strong>1994:</strong> Jackson settles the molestation case out of
              court. The boy is paid more than $15 million, to be held in trust

              child's mother is never revealed. Jackson says the child is the

              <strong>2006:</strong> Financial troubles force closure on the
              main house on the Neverland Ranch. Jackson agrees to a Sony-backed
              refinancing deal. Jackson makes his first public appearance since
              the Arvizo trial to accept eight records from the Guinness World
              Records in London, including "Most Successful Entertainer of All
